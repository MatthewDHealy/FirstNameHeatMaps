# FirstNameHeatmaps

This is an example of a dynamic data visualization tool build using MS Excel.  It is also an example
of how to do Reproducible Research in a spreadsheet program:

1. The source URLs and each portion of the data are kept as copied, without any further editing.
2. Further rearrangements of the data are done using formulas only, without doing any manual
copying and pasting of the data.
3. Conditional Formatting is used to validate the lookups

This is also an example of how to make clean heatmaps in Excel using some formatting tricks.

And this is an example of how a few simple Forms Tools (Scrollbars and Spinners) can make an
interactive tool.
