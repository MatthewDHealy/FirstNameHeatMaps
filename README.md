# FirstNameHeatmaps

This is an example of a dynamic data visualization tool built using MS Excel.  It is also an example
of how to do Reproducible Research in a spreadsheet program:

Download the Excel file, and open in MS Excel.  Enable Editing so you can use the Spinner and
Scrollbar to change the base year for comparisons, and notice how baby names have gone up and
down in popularity in the US over the past 130 years.  I find it particularly fascinating how
some names are always fairly common, while some names that were popular in the late 1800s have
recently come back.  And some names that were common in the middle of the twentieth century
were rare before and after that era.

1. The source URLs and each portion of the data are kept as copied, without any further editing.
2. Further rearrangements of the data are done using formulas only, without doing any manual
copying and pasting of the data.
3. Conditional Formatting is used to validate the lookups

This is also an example of how to make clean heatmaps in Excel using some formatting tricks.

And this is an example of how a few simple Forms Tools (Scrollbars and Spinners) can make an
interactive tool.

The Excel file cannot be viewed online; you need to download it and open locally in MS Excel
on your computer.  Unfortunately, this particular tool depends on some features unique to
MS Excel so it does not work in Libre Office.

The PDF and PNG files are sample heatmaps generated by the Excel tool.
